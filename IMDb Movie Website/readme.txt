This project has been individually developed by Sneha Shankar as part of the CS143 coursework.

Some general instructions are:
-Make sure to use correct queries in the web UI. Failure to do so will not render any results. End all querie with a semi-colon.
-I have used styling in the html page with the <style> tag. Since, it is not in bootstrap, the web-page will not be resposive.
